		<h2>Scope</h2>
		<p>A JavaScript Closure is when an inner function has access to members of the outer function (lexical scope) even when executing outside the scope of the outer function.</p>
		<p>Scope refers to the extent of visibility of a variable defined in a program. Ways to create scope in JavaScript are through: try-catch blocks, functions, the let keyword with curly braces among others. We mainly have two variations of scope: the global scope and local scope.</p>
